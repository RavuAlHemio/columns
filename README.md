# Columns

A Rust and SDL2-based revival of Duff Software's [Kolumz](https://archive.org/details/Kolumz_1020) game.

## Controls

* _left arrow_ and _right arrow_: move descending blocks left or right

* _up arrow_: cycle the colors of the descending blocks

* _down arrow_: immediately drop the descending blocks

* _F2_: start new game

* _F3_: pause/unpause

* _Escape_: exit

Apart from the arrow keys, the game also supports WASD (left hand) and IJKL (right hand) controls analogously.
